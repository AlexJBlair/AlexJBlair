### Hi there 👋

<!--
**AlexJBlair/AlexJBlair** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->


- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning how to make games and web apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to utilize Angular and Dotnet Core 7 for full stack web development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun, but mostly web based or game based projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with everything. Constructive feedback is something I thrive on. 😁
- 💬 Ask me about my favorite type of coffee, or maybe what my cats are doing.
- 📫 How to reach me: email is linked in my profile, I also frequent discord and I am happy to join dev communities. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I speak some basic German, roughly an elementary - middle school level.
